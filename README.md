# MERN Stack Capstone Project

🏥 MediReach — MERN Healthcare Appointment System

MediReach is a full-stack healthcare appointment platform built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).
It allows patients to register, log in, book appointments, view bookings, receive confirmations via email and SMS (Twilio), and interact with healthcare providers in a modern and user-friendly interface.

This project was developed as part of the PLP MERN Stack Final Project, demonstrating authentication, protected routes, API integration, and CRUD operations.

Designed for simplicity, automation, and accessibility, MediReach improves how patients connect with medical professionals—making healthcare more efficient and convenient.
